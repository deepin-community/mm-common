Description: Common build files of the GNOME C++ bindings
 The mm-common module provides the build infrastructure and utilities
 shared among the GNOME C++ binding libraries.  It is only a required
 dependency for building the C++ bindings from the gnome.org version
 control repository.  An installation of mm-common is not required for
 building tarball releases, unless configured to use maintainer-mode.
 .
 The mm-common package also includes a snapshot of the Doxygen tag file
 for the GNU C++ Library reference documentation.
